1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] allows clients to encrypt messages exchanged
   with an HTTP target server accessed via an Oblivious Relay Resource
   (relay) and an Oblivious Gateway Resource (gateway), in such a way
   that the relay cannot inspect the contents of the message and the
   gateway does not discover the client's identity.  In order to use
   Oblivious HTTP, clients need to possess a key configuration to use to
   encrypt messages to the gateway.

   Since Oblivious HTTP deployments will often involve very specific
   coordination between clients, relays, and gateways, the key
   configuration can often be shared in a bespoke fashion.  However,
   some deployments involve clients discovering oblivious gateways more
   dynamically.  For example, a network may want to advertise a DNS
   resolver that is accessible over Oblivious HTTP and applies local
   network resolution policies via mechanisms like Discovery of
   Designated Resolvers ([DDR].  Clients can work with trusted relays to
   access these gateways.

   This document defines a mechanism to advertise that an HTTP service
   supports Oblivious HTTP using DNS records, as a parameter that can be
   included in SVCB and HTTPS DNS resource records [SVCB].  The presence
   of this parameter indicates that a service can act as an oblivious
   gateway; see Section 2 of [OHTTP] for a description of oblivious
   gateway.

   This document also defines a well-known URI [RFC8615], "oblivious-
   configs", that can be used to look up key configurations on a service
   that is known act as an oblivious gateway.

   This mechanism does not aid in the discovery of relays to use to
   access oblivious gateways; the configuration of proxies is out of
   scope for this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The oblivious SvcParamKey

   The "oblivious" SvcParamKey (Section 6) is used to indicate that a
   service described in an SVCB record can act as an oblivious gateway
   resource.  Clients can issue requests to this service through an
   oblivious relay once they learn the key configuration to use to
   encrypt messages to the oblivious gateway.

   Both the presentation and wire format values for the "oblivious"
   parameter MUST be empty.

   The "oblivious" parameter can be included in the mandatory parameter
   list to ensure that clients that do not support oblivious access do
   not try to use the service.  Services that mark oblivious support as
   mandatory can, therefore, indicate that the service might not be
   accessible in a non-oblivious fashion.  Services that are intended to
   be accessed either with an oblivious gateway or directly SHOULD NOT
   mark the "oblivious" parameter as mandatory.  Note that since
   multiple SVCB responses can be provided for a single query, the
   oblivious and non-oblivious versions of a single service can have
   different SVCB records to support different names or properties.

   The scheme to use for oblivious requests made to a service depends on
   the scheme of the SVCB record.  This document defines the
   interpretation for the "https" [SVCB] and "dns" [DNS-SVCB] schemes.
   Other schemes that want to use this parameter MUST define the
   interpretation and meaning of the configuration.

3.1.  Use in HTTPS service records

   For the "https" scheme, which uses the HTTPS RR type instead of SVCB,
   the presence of the "oblivious" parameter means that the service
   being described is an Oblivious HTTP service that uses the default
   "message/bhttp" media type [OHTTP] [BINARY-HTTP].

   For example, an HTTPS service record for svc.example.com that
   supports an oblivious gateway could look like this:

   svc.example.com. 7200  IN HTTPS 1 . alpn=h2,h2 oblivious

   A similar record for a service that only support oblivious
   connectivity could look like this:

   oblivious-svc.example.com. 7200  IN HTTPS 1 . (
       mandatory=oblivious oblivious )

3.2.  Use in DNS server SVCB records

   For the "dns" scheme, as defined in [DNS-SVCB], the presence of the
   "oblivious" parameter means that the DNS server being described is an
   Oblivious DNS over HTTP (DoH) service.  The default media type
   expected for use in Oblivious HTTP to DNS resolvers is "application/
   dns-message" [DOH].

   In order for DNS servers to function as oblivious gateways, they need
   to be accessible via an oblivious relay.  Encrypted DNS servers used
   with the discovery mechanisms described in this section can either be
   publicly accessible, or specific to a network.  In general, only
   publicly accessible DNS servers will work as Oblivious DNS servers,
   unless there is a coordinated deployment with an oblivious proxy that
   is also hosted within a network.

3.2.1.  Use with DDR

   Clients can discover an oblivious DNS server configuration using DDR,
   by either querying _dns.resolver.arpa to a locally configured
   resolver or querying using the name of a resolver [DDR].

   For example, a DoH service advertised over DDR can be annotated as
   supporting oblivious resolution using the following record:

   _dns.resolver.arpa  7200  IN SVCB 1 doh.example.net (
        alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} oblivious )

   Clients still need to perform some verification of oblivious DNS
   servers, such as the TLS certificate check described in [DDR].  This
   certificate check can be done when looking up the configuration on
   the resolver using the well-known URI (Section 4), which can either
   be done directly, or via a proxy to avoid exposing client IP
   addresses.

   Clients also need to ensure that they are not being targeted with
   unique key configurations that would reveal their identity.  See
   Section 5 for more discussion.

3.2.2.  Use with DNR

   The SvcParamKeys defined in this document also can be used with
   Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) [DNR].  In this case,
   the oblivious configuration and path parameters can be included in
   DHCP and Router Advertisement messages.

   While DNR does not require the same kind of verification as DDR,
   clients still need to ensure that they are not being targeted with
   unique key configurations that would reveal their identity.  See
   Section 5 for more discussion.

4.  Configuration Well-Known URI

   Clients that know a service is available as an oblivious gateway,
   e.g., either via discovery through the "oblivious" parameter in a
   SVCB or HTTPS record, or by configuration, need to know the key
   configuration before sending oblivious requests.

   This document defines a well-known URI [RFC8615], "oblivious-
   configs", that allows a gateway to host its configurations.

   The URI is constructed using the TargetName in the associated
   ServiceMode SVCB record.

   For example, the URI for the following record:

   svc.example.com. 7200  IN HTTPS 1 . alpn=h2,h2 oblivious

   would be "https://svc.example.com/.well-known/oblivious-configs".

   As another example, the URI for the following record:

   _dns.resolver.arpa  7200  IN SVCB 1 doh.example.net (
        alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} oblivious )

   would be "https://doh.example.net/.well-known/oblivious-configs".

   The content of this resource is expected to be "application/ohttp-
   keys", as defined in [OHTTP].

   Before being able to use a server as an oblivious gatweay, clients
   need to use this URI to fetch the configuration.  They can either
   fetch it directly, or do so via a proxy in order to avoid the server
   discovering information about the client's identity.  See Section 5
   for more discussion of avoiding key targeting attacks.

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   Attackers on a network can remove SVCB information from cleartext DNS
   answers that are not protected by DNSSEC [DNSSEC].  This can
   effectively downgrade clients.  However, since SVCB indications for
   oblivious support are just hints, a client can mitigate this by
   always checking for oblivious gateway information.  Use of encrypted
   DNS or DNSSEC also can be used as mitigations.

   When discovering designated oblivious DNS servers using this
   mechanism, clients need to ensure that the designation is trusted in
   lieu of being able to directly check the contents of the gateway
   server's TLS certificate.  See Section 3.2.1 for more discussion, as
   well as the Security Considerations of [I-D.ietf-add-svcb-dns].

   As discussed in [OHTTP], client requests using Oblivious HTTP can
   only be linked by recognizing the key configuration.  In order to
   prevent unwanted linkability and tracking, clients using any key
   configuration discovery mechanism need to be concerned with attacks
   that target a specific user or population with a unique key
   configuration.

   There are several approaches clients can use to mitigate key
   targeting attacks.  [CONSISTENCY] provides an analysis of the options
   for ensuring the key configurations are consistent between different
   clients.  Clients SHOULD employ some technique to mitigate key
   targeting attack.  Oblivious gateways that are detected to use
   targeted key configurations per-client MUST NOT be used.

   When clients fetch a gateway's configuration using the well-known
   URI, they can expose their identity in the form of an IP address if
   they do not connect via a proxy or some other IP-hiding mechanism.
   Clients SHOULD use a proxy or similar mechanism to avoid exposing
   client IPs to a gateway.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  SVCB Service Parameter

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the SVCB Service
   Parameters registry ([SVCB]).

   +========+===========+=================================+===========+
   | Number | Name      | Meaning                         | Reference |
   +========+===========+=================================+===========+
   | TBD    | oblivious | Describes if a service operates | (This     |
   |        |           | an oblivious HTTP gateway       | document) |
   +--------+-----------+---------------------------------+-----------+

                                 Table 1

6.2.  Well-Known URI

   IANA is requested to add a new entry in the "Well-Known URIs"
   registry [RFC8615] with the following information:

   URI suffix: oblivious-configs

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document: This document
