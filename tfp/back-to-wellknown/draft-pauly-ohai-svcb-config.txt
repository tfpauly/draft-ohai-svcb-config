1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] allows clients to encrypt messages exchanged
   with an Oblivious Target Resource (target).  The messages are
   encapsulated in encrypted messages to an Oblivious Gateway Resource
   (gateway), which gates access to the target.  The gateway is access
   via an Oblivious Relay Resource (relay), which proxies the
   encapsulated messages to hide the identity of the client.  Overall,
   this architecture is designed in such a way that the relay cannot
   inspect the contents of messages, and the gateway and target cannot
   discover the client's identity.

   Since Oblivious HTTP deployments will often involve very specific
   coordination between clients, relays, and gateways, the key
   configuration can often be shared in a bespoke fashion.  However,
   some deployments involve clients discovering oblivious targets and
   their assoicated gateways more dynamically.  For example, a network
   may want to advertise a DNS resolver that is accessible over
   Oblivious HTTP and applies local network resolution policies via
   mechanisms like Discovery of Designated Resolvers ([DDR].  Clients
   can work with trusted relays to access these gateways.

   This document defines a mechanism to advertise that an HTTP service
   supports Oblivious HTTP using DNS records, as a parameter that can be
   included in SVCB and HTTPS DNS resource records [SVCB].  The presence
   of this parameter indicates that a service can act as an oblivious
   target and has an oblivious gateway that can provide access to the
   target.

   The client learns the URI to use for the oblivious gateway using a
   well-known URI [WELLKNOWN], "oblivious-gateway", which is accessed on
   the oblivious target (Section 4).

   This document also defines a way to fetch an oblivious gateway's key
   configuration from the oblivious gateway (Section 5).

   This mechanism does not aid in the discovery of oblivious relays;
   relay configuration is out of scope for this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The oblivious SvcParamKey

   The "oblivious" SvcParamKey (Section 7) is used to indicate that a
   service described in an SVCB record can be accessed as an oblivious
   target using an associated gateway.  The service that is queried by
   the client hosts one or more target resources.

   In order to access the service's target resources obliviously, the
   client needs to send encapsulated messages to the gateway resource
   and the gateway's key configuration (both of which can be retrieved
   using the method described in Section 5).

   Both the presentation and wire format values for the "oblivious"
   parameter MUST be empty.

   The "oblivious" parameter can be included in the mandatory parameter
   list to ensure that clients that do not support oblivious access do
   not try to use the service.  Services that mark the oblivious
   parameter as mandatory can, therefore, indicate that the service
   might not be accessible in a non-oblivious fashion.  Services that
   are intended to be accessed either obliviously or directly SHOULD NOT
   mark the "oblivious" parameter as mandatory.  Note that since
   multiple SVCB responses can be provided for a single query, the
   oblivious and non-oblivious versions of a single service can have
   different SVCB records to support different names or properties.

   The media type to use for encapsulated requests made to a target
   service depends on the scheme of the SVCB record.  This document
   defines the interpretation for the "https" [SVCB] and "dns"
   [DNS-SVCB] schemes.  Other schemes that want to use this parameter
   MUST define the interpretation and meaning of the configuration.

3.1.  Use in HTTPS service records

   For the "https" scheme, which uses the HTTPS RR type instead of SVCB,
   the presence of the "oblivious" parameter means that the target being
   described is an Oblivious HTTP service that is accessible using the
   default "message/bhttp" media type [OHTTP] [BINARY-HTTP].

   For example, an HTTPS service record for svc.example.com that
   supports an oblivious gateway could look like this:

   svc.example.com. 7200  IN HTTPS 1 . ( alpn=h2 oblivious )

   A similar record for a service that only support oblivious
   connectivity could look like this:

   svc.example.com. 7200  IN HTTPS 1 . ( mandatory=oblivious oblivious )

3.2.  Use in DNS server SVCB records

   For the "dns" scheme, as defined in [DNS-SVCB], the presence of the
   "oblivious" parameter means that the DNS server being described is an
   Oblivious DNS over HTTP (DoH) service.  The default media type
   expected for use in Oblivious HTTP to DNS resolvers is "application/
   dns-message" [DOH].

   In order for DNS servers to function as oblivious targets, their
   associated gateways need to be accessible via an oblivious relay.
   Encrypted DNS servers used with the discovery mechanisms described in
   this section can either be publicly accessible, or specific to a
   network.  In general, only publicly accessible DNS servers will work
   as oblivious DNS servers, unless there is a coordinated deployment
   with an oblivious relay that is also hosted within a network.

3.2.1.  Use with DDR

   Clients can discover an oblivious DNS server configuration using DDR,
   by either querying _dns.resolver.arpa to a locally configured
   resolver or querying using the name of a resolver [DDR].

   For example, a DoH service advertised over DDR can be annotated as
   supporting oblivious resolution using the following record:

   _dns.resolver.arpa  7200  IN SVCB 1 doh.example.net (
        alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} oblivious )

   Clients still need to perform some verification of oblivious DNS
   servers, such as the TLS certificate check described in [DDR].  This
   certificate check can be done when looking up the configuration on
   the gateway as described in Section 5, which can either be done
   directly, or via the relay or another proxy to avoid exposing client
   IP addresses.

   For the case of DoH servers, clients also need to ensure that they
   are not being targeted with unique DoH paths that would reveal their
   identity.  See Section 6 for more discussion.

3.2.2.  Use with DNR

   The SvcParamKeys defined in this document also can be used with
   Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) [DNR].  In this case,
   the oblivious configuration and path parameters can be included in
   DHCP and Router Advertisement messages.

   While DNR does not require the same kind of verification as DDR,
   clients that learn about DoH servers still need to ensure that they
   are not being targeted with unique DoH paths that would reveal their
   identity.  See Section 6 for more discussion.

4.  Gateway Location

   Clients that know a service is available as an oblivious target via
   discovery through the "oblivious" parameter in a SVCB or HTTPS record
   need to know the location of the associated oblivious gateway before
   sending oblivious requests.

   By default, the oblivious gateway for an oblivious target is defined
   as a well-known resource ([WELLKNOWN]) on the target, "/.well-known/
   oblivious-gateway".

   Commonly, servers will not want to actually operate the oblivious
   gateway on a well-known URI.  In such cases, servers can use 3xx
   redirection responses (Section 15.4 of [HTTP]) to direct clients and
   relays to the correct location of the oblivious gateway.

   Generally, the first request a client will make will be a GET request
   to discover the key configuration, described in Section 5.  This
   initial request also provides a convenient way for clients to learn
   about the redirect from the well-known resource, if there is a
   redirect.  When clients work with their oblivious relays to send
   oblivious requests to the gateway, clients can communicate this
   redirected gateway URI.

5.  Key Configuration Fetching

   Clients also need to know the key configuration of an oblivious
   gateway before sending oblivious requests.

   In order to fetch the key configuration of an oblivious gateway
   discovered in the manner described in Section 4, the client issues a
   GET request to the URI of the gateway specifying the "application/
   ohttp-keys" ([OHTTP]) media type in the Accept header.

   For example, if the client knows an oblivious gateway URI,
   "https://osvc.example.com/gateway", it could fetch the key
   configuration with the following request:

   GET /gateway HTTP/1.1
   Host: osvc.example.com
   Accept: application/ohttp-keys

   Oblivious gateways that coordinate with targets that advertise
   oblivious support SHOULD support GET requests for their key
   configuration in this manner, unless there is another out-of-band
   configuration model that is usable by clients.  Gateways respond with
   their key configuration in the response body, with a content type of
   "application/ohttp-keys".

   Clients can either fetch this key configuration directly, or do so
   via a proxy in order to avoid the server discovering information
   about the client's identity.  See Section 6 for more discussion of
   avoiding key targeting attacks.

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   Attackers on a network can remove SVCB information from cleartext DNS
   answers that are not protected by DNSSEC [DNSSEC].  This can
   effectively downgrade clients.  However, since SVCB indications for
   oblivious support are just hints, a client can mitigate this by
   always checking for oblivious gateway configuration Section 5 on the
   well-known gateway location Section 4.  Use of encrypted DNS along
   with DNSSEC can also be used as a mitigation.

   When discovering designated oblivious DNS servers using this
   mechanism, clients need to ensure that the designation is trusted in
   lieu of being able to directly check the contents of the gateway
   server's TLS certificate.  See Section 3.2.1 for more discussion, as
   well as the Security Considerations of [SVCBDNS].

   For oblivious DoH servers, an attacker could use unique DoH path
   values to target or identify specific clients.  Clients can mitigate
   such attacks in several ways.  Some options include: only allow
   common DoH paths (such as the de-facto default "/dns-query{?dns}");
   performing consistency checks by fetching the information about the
   resolver over multiple resolution paths; or coordinating with a
   trusted oblivious relay to validate that DoH paths are common across
   clients using the same gateway.

   As discussed in [OHTTP], client requests using Oblivious HTTP can
   only be linked by recognizing the key configuration.  In order to
   prevent unwanted linkability and tracking, clients using any key
   configuration discovery mechanism need to be concerned with attacks
   that target a specific user or population with a unique key
   configuration.

   There are several approaches clients can use to mitigate key
   targeting attacks.  [CONSISTENCY] provides an analysis of the options
   for ensuring the key configurations are consistent between different
   clients.  Clients SHOULD employ some technique to mitigate key
   targeting attack.  Oblivious gateways that are detected to use
   targeted key configurations per-client MUST NOT be used.

   When clients fetch a gateway's configuration (Section 5), they can
   expose their identity in the form of an IP address if they do not
   connect via a proxy or some other IP-hiding mechanism.  In some
   circumstances, this might not be a privacy concern, since revealing
   that a particular client IP address is preparing to use an Oblivious
   HTTP service can be expected.  However, if a client is otherwise
   trying to obfuscate its IP address or location (and not merely
   decouple its specific requests from its IP address), or revealing its
   IP address will increase the risk of a key targeting attack (if a
   gateway service is trying to differentiate traffic across client IP
   addresses), a proxy or similar mechanism can be used to fetch the
   gateway's configuration.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  SVCB Service Parameter

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the SVCB Service
   Parameters registry ([SVCB]).

   +========+===========+=================================+===========+
   | Number | Name      | Meaning                         | Reference |
   +========+===========+=================================+===========+
   | TBD    | oblivious | Denotes that a service operates | (This     |
   |        |           | an oblivious HTTP target        | document) |
   +--------+-----------+---------------------------------+-----------+

                                 Table 1

7.2.  Well-Known URI

   IANA is requested to add one new entry in the "Well-Known URIs"
   registry [WELLKNOWN].

   URI suffix: oblivious-gateway
