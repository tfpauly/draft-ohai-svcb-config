Whether that is a privacy problem depends on the threat model, I think.

That is all the HTTPS record is able to assert.  See also, the closed #12, which talked about `ohttp-path`.  This is fine, as OHTTP doesn't really care what you put inside the encrypted message to the oblivious request resource, so an origin-wide assertion works fine as long as your intermediaries (proxy and request resources) are OK with it.\r\n\r\nWhat you then need in order to make a request is a) an oblivious proxy resource, and b) an oblivious request resource.  The draft acknowledges the need for the first and says that you bring your own.  What it doesn't say is how to get the latter.  \r\n\r\nAs OHTTP depends on these being independent entities, it isn't at all clear that the choice of oblivious request resource follows from your choice of oblivious proxy resource OR the choice of oblivious target resource.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that clients will have separate arrangements with entities that operate both proxy and request resources, entities that are independent of this target.  That's probably the ideal situation.\r\n\r\nAs we've discussed though, it makes a fair bit of sense to co-locate the request resource with the target.  For that, you need to know which resource on the server serves that function.  A .well-known for that is a possibility, though I might prefer not to overuse .well-known and might instead suggest that you would provide a path to the request resource in configuration.  There is no harm in allowing configuration for that resource.",

Origin-wide configuration, where there might be multiple oblivious request resources on the same server, is inflexible.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to facilitate discovery without specifying paths, then putting the path of the oblivious request resource into the SVCB (HTTPS really) configuration might work.  Or, if you don't like your configuration too explicit, a well-known location for an oblivious request resource that is able to forward oblivious requests to any oblivious target resource on the same origin might also work.",

      "body": "> When clients fetch a target's configuration using the well-known URI, they can expose their identity in the form of an IP addres if they do not connect via a proxy or some other IP-hiding mechanism. Clients SHOULD use a proxy or similar mechanism to avoid exposing client IPs to a target.\r\n\r\nFetching key configuration does not necessarily reveal sensitive information other than that the client is interested in the answer.  It is worth pointing out that clients that wish to hide any interest in the resources provided by the server might want to break any tie between their IP address and this interest, but there are lots of cases where that is not necessary.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we might not find it useful to try to hide the fact that Firefox is running on a particular computer.  If Firefox requests oblivious key configuration information from our chosen DNS provider, all that we reveal is that Firefox is running, something we will reveal soon afterwards by virtue of establishing TLS connections to a bunch of servers.  So there is little value in us protecting this information.\r\n\r\nIt might be better to frame this in a more nuanced fashion.  Talk instead about the consequences of leaking information about interest in the services being offered and how that is tied to network identity unless protective measures are taken (proxy, MASQUE, VPN, Tor, etc...)  A \"SHOULD\" is not appropriate, depending on circumstances.",

DNSSEC provides integrity and so - if it is used - is effective.  Of course, it is pretty hard to *get* DNSSEC responses at a stub resolver reliably, but that doesn't mean you can't recommend it.\r\n\r\nEncrypted DNS (DoH, DoT, etc...) helps differently.  It means that you are no longer exposed to network-based attackers.  But that assumes three things if you don't have DNSSEC:\r\n\r\n1. you are able to get (authenticated and) encrypted DNS to the recursive resolver\r\n2. your recursive resolver doesn't strip SVCB (or the oblivious flag; or the entire mandatory=oblivious RRs) from responses\r\n3. you are able to get (authenticated and) encrypted DNS between the recursive and the authoritative.\r\n\r\nYou can drop the last if your recursive does DNSSEC validation for you, which means you are relying on having encrypted DNS *and* DNSSEC.",
